# Frequency Liberation and Interchangeable Country Kit

## FAQ
**Q:** What is this?

**A:** You'll figure it out.

---

**Q:** Why not just use one of the many custom firmwares that exist?

**A:** I prefer the stability, support, and ease of use of the official firmware. Why make a whole fork that I gotta maintain when I can make a single app that will work with minimal update chasing needed?

---

**Q:** How do I use this app?

**A:** Run it, select `FLICK` to FLICK your Flipper (keeping a backup of the original data on the SD card). If its been FLICK'ed, an option to un-FLICK will appear; this will restore the data from SD card back to the flipper.

---

**Q:** What is the password to FLICK my Flipper?

**A:** Read the EULA, or the source code; you'll figure it out. Gotta make it just annoying/difficult enough for the skids to lose interest.

---

**Q:** Is it safe?

**A:** Probably! I made sure the max power is the same as the max power that the official firmware uses for any given region. More power than most, and it probably won't damage anything. But I can't promise anything, use this at your own risk.

---

**Q:** What is the app icon?

**A:** Coffee bean. If you can make a better looking one, open a PR please.

---

**Q:** I want XYZ feature!

**A:** Great! Open a PR.
